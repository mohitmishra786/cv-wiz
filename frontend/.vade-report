- **File Modified**: `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`
  - Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after the `<SessionProvider>` and `<ThemeProvider>` wrapper components
  - The component is positioned correctly to track all page views and interactions across the application

### Implementation Details

- Root layout file: `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`
- Inside the body tag as recommended
- After the providers (SessionProvider and ThemeProvider) to ensure proper initialization
